==================
PyRabbit
==================

pyrabbit is a module to make it easy to interface w/ RabbitMQ's HTTP Management
API.  It's tested against RabbitMQ 2.4.1 and 2.6.1 using Python 2.6-3.2. It has 
a pretty solid set of tests, and I use tox to test across Python versions.

This module isn't on pypi because the name was taken by a project that, by all 
appearances, is either dead or bogus, but the powers that be don't think it proper 
to release the name for me to use, so you'll have to get it here :/

PyRabbit is on PyPI, which makes it installable using pip or easy_install.
