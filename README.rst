==================
PyRabbit
==================

pyrabbit is a module to make it easy to interface w/ RabbitMQ's HTTP Management
API.  It's tested against RabbitMQ 2.4.1 and 2.6.1 using Python 2.6-3.2. Yes, it works
great w/ Python 3! It has a pretty solid set of tests, and I use tox to test across 
Python versions.
